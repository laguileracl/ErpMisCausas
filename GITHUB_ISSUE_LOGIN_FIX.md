# Issue: Login Authentication Fix in Production

## Problem Description
The login functionality is failing in the Vercel production deployment with two critical issues:

### 1. Login Button Visibility
- The "Iniciar sesi√≥n" button is not clearly visible or appears disabled
- Users cannot properly interact with the login form

### 2. Authentication API Error
- Login attempts result in `404: The page could not be found NOT_FOUND` error
- The `/api/auth/login` endpoint is not responding correctly
- Railway backend API connection is failing

## Current Behavior
- User enters credentials (admin/admin123)
- Button may appear disabled or unclear
- Clicking login results in 404 error
- Authentication fails completely

## Expected Behavior
- Clear, visible login button
- Successful authentication with admin/admin123 credentials
- Redirect to dashboard after successful login
- Proper error handling for invalid credentials

## Technical Details
- Frontend: Deployed on Vercel (erp-mis-causas.vercel.app)
- Backend: Should connect to Railway API (erp-miscausas-production.up.railway.app)
- Authentication endpoint: `/api/auth/login`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Login button is clearly visible and interactive
- [ ] Authentication works with admin/admin123
- [ ] Proper error messages for invalid credentials
- [ ] Successful redirect to dashboard
- [ ] Railway API connectivity restored

## Priority
High - Blocking user access to the application
