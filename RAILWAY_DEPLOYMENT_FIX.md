# Railway Deployment Issue - Root Cause Analysis and Fix

## Problem Identified
Railway returning 404 "Application not found" for all endpoints including `/health`

## Root Cause
The Railway deployment is failing because:
1. Server not starting properly on Railway's assigned PORT
2. Potential issue with the production-standalone.ts configuration
3. Railway may not be detecting the correct start command

## Immediate Fix Required

### 1. Update Railway Configuration
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "DOCKERFILE"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npx tsx server/production-standalone.ts",
    "healthcheckPath": "/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 300,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

### 2. Verify Dockerfile PORT Configuration
The Dockerfile should expose the correct port and the server should bind to 0.0.0.0:$PORT

### 3. Test Commands to Execute

```bash
# Commit current fixes
git add server/production-standalone.ts railway.json client/src/lib/queryClient.ts client/src/lib/auth.tsx vercel.json VERCEL_TROUBLESHOOTING.md
git commit -m "Fix Railway and Vercel deployment issues

- Update production server port binding for Railway
- Fix Vercel configuration for frontend deployment  
- Update authentication to handle API connectivity
- Add comprehensive troubleshooting guides"
git push origin main
```

### 4. Railway Dashboard Actions Required
1. Check deployment logs in Railway dashboard
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Trigger manual redeploy if needed
4. Monitor build and runtime logs

### 5. Verification Steps
Once deployed:
- Test: `curl https://erp-miscausas-production.up.railway.app/health`
- Test: `curl -X POST https://erp-miscausas-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}'`

## Expected Outcome
- Railway backend: Working API at erp-miscausas-production.up.railway.app
- Vercel frontend: Working app at erp-mis-causas.vercel.app
- Full authentication flow functional
